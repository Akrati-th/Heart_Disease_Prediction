# Heart Disease Prediction Project

This project is an attempt to apply Data Analysis and Data Science Algorithms on the provided data. This project helps in finding the major notions behind the Heart Diseases purely from the perspective of the data. 

## Dataset

The dataset used in the project is shown below -

The objective of this project is to create a Model which is capable of predicting the possibility of Heart Disease in a person depending on the Count of the following:
```
age:			age
sex:			1: male, 0: female
cp:			chest pain type, 1: typical angina, 2: atypical angina, 3: non-anginal pain, 4: asymptomatic
trestbps:			resting blood pressure
chol:			 serum cholestoral in mg/dl
fbs:			fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl
restecg:			resting electrocardiographic results (values 0,1,2)
thalach:			 maximum heart rate achieved
exang:			exercise induced angina
oldpeak:			oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
slope:			the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
ca:			number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
thal:			thal: 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect
```

## Visualisations

Visualizations of the data helped in understanding the role of each attribute in the given Dataset in causing Heart diseases within an individuals.

Some of these visualizations are displayed below -

## Decision Tree Classifier
Decision Tree is a Supervised Learning technique that can be used for both Classification and Regression problems, but mostly it is preferred for solving Classification problems. It is a Tree-Structured Classifier, where internal nodes represent the features of a dataset, branches represent the decision rules and each leaf node represents the outcome.
In a Decision tree, there are two nodes, which are the Decision Node and Leaf Node. Decision nodes are used to make any decision and have multiple branches, whereas Leaf nodes are the output of those decisions and do not contain any further branches.
The decisions or the test are performed on the basis of features of the given Dataset. It is a graphical representation for getting all the possible solutions to a problem/decision based on given conditions. Decision Tree Classifier gives the solution of the decision in either YES or NO.
