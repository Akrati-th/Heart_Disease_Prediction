# Heart Disease Prediction Project
This project is an attempt to generate a Machine Learning Model which is capable of predicting the possibility of Heart Disease in a person depending on the Count of the following 

This project is an attempt to apply **Data Analysis** and **Data Science Algorithms** on the provided data. This project helps in finding the major **notions** behind the Heart Diseases purely from the perspective of the data.
